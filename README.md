# Food Nation

Birthed from a Hackathon, Food Nation is a web application that allows the user to discover the national dishes of the majority of countries on the Earth. Access [the live demo] for a demonstration.

## Features

  - Search or click on the interactive map for countries around the world to find its respective national dish.
  - Read the descriptions of the national dishes.
  - Watch provided YouTube videos to learn the recipes of the national dishes.
  - Search for local restaurants that provide the national dishes utilizing Yelp's and Google Map's APIs.

## Planned Features
  - Online food ordering and delivery integration (PostMates, Uber EATS, etc.).
  - Comment section for users to post own reviews of national dishes.

## Personal Insight
> Food Nation is a proud achievement as we, the development team, while only having just a few weeks of web development experience, only had two days to create a web application from the ground up. The project was a transition from developing games to practical, useful web applications. 
> Another key point is that Food Nation is our first project to heavily utilize APIs. The goal of this Hackathon was to educate the usage of APIs and how they interact with the front-end. This knowledge was important, especially for those going into back-end development who would have to create their own APIs for future projects.
